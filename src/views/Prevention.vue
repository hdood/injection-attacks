                    Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to monitor and filter HTTP traffic between a web
                    application and the Internet. A WAF can help detect and block injection attacks by analyzing
                    patterns and behaviors indicative of such attacks.

                <div class="fragment text-3xl fade-in-then-out">
                    Conduct regular security testing, including static analysis and dynamic analysis, to identify
                    vulnerabilities in the application code and database configurations. Automated tools and manual
                    penetration testing can help uncover potential injection points.

                    Keep software frameworks, libraries, and the underlying infrastructure up-to-date to patch known
                    vulnerabilities. Regularly check for security updates and apply them promptly to address any
                    potential weaknesses that could be exploited in injection attacks.

                    In conclusion, defending against injection cyber attacks demands a multifaceted strategy. Employing
                    rigorous input validation, adhering to the least privilege principle, and integrating tools like Web
                    Application Firewalls (WAF) create a robust defense. Regular security testing and proactive software
                    updates are essential for staying ahead of evolving threats. A vigilant, layered approach is key to
                    safeguarding data integrity and maintaining user trust in the face of persistent injection
                    vulnerabilities. </div>
